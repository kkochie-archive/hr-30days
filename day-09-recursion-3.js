Recursion --EASY

Today we are learning about algorithmic concept called recursion. 

Recursive Method for Calculating Factorial
  factorial(N) = {1                     N <= 1
                  N x factorial(N - 1)  otherwise

Function Description:
Complete the factorial function. Be sure to use recursion.

factorial has the following parameter:
• int n: an integer

Returns:
• int: the factorial of n

Note: if you fail to use recursion or fail to name your recursive function factorial or Factorial, you will get a score of 0.

Input Format:
A single integer, n (the argument to pass to factorial)

Constraints:
• 2 <= n <= 12
• submission must contain a recursive
